** every rvalue can be constants

add a b c -> a = b + c

same goes for sub

lw x y -> load from y memory location to x register

sw x y -> store x register's content to y memory location

mult x y z -> x = y * z

same goes for div

beq a b label -> jump to label if a = b
bneq a b label -> jump to label if a != b
blt a b label -> jump to label if a < b
bgt a b label -> jump to label if a > b
ble a b label -> jump to label if a <= b
bge a b label -> jump to label if a >= b

jmp label -> jump to label
